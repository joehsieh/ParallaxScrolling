#What is parallax scrolling ï¼Ÿ

When the foregroundView is scrolling down, it will scroll down the backgroundvView with slower speed too. It will make an illusion of depth. It is called parallax scrolling.
Sometimes it is not cool if it only exists parallax scrolling in an App, so we provide more effect for backgroundView when the foregroundView is scrolling down.(e.g. Enlarges / Blurs the image in the backgroundView.)

In this example.
The blurred image of Jordan is going to slam down is the backgroundView.
The rounded image of Jordan and the discover button are in the headerView.
The list of player name and suffle button are in the foregroundView.

Enjoy it !
